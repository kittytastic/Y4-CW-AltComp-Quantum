Let the player's strategy be to guess the first bit if they measure 0 and guess the second bit if they message 1.
\begin{align*}
    P(\text{correct}) &= 1-P(\text{incorrect})\\
        &= 1-(\frac{1}{2}(1-\beta^2))\\
        &= 1-\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\beta^2}{2}\\
        &= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\beta^2}{2}\\
\end{align*}

Therefore their advantage is 
\[\frac{\beta^2}{2} = \Omega(\beta^2)\]
